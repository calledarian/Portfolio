                        Hey there! I'm a junior developer and freelancer passionate about solving real-life problems through technology. I started with Python and Pygame to build games, then expanded into full-stack web development.

                    <p>
                        Iâ€™m currently building meaningful apps using Type/JavaScript, ReactJS, and NestJS, with MySQL and PostgreSQL as my databases of choice.
