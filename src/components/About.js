                        Hey there! I'm a freelance developer who loves building full-stack web apps that are clean, functional, and actually solve problems. From the front end to the back, I enjoy bringing ideas to life through code.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Right now, I’m looking for junior developer roles where I can grow, collaborate with a great team, and keep leveling up my skills with React, NestJS, TypeScript, and SQL databases.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Outside of coding, I’m probably jamming on my guitar, lifting at the gym, or trying to outthink someone in chess.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
        </section>
    )
}
